In 2015, NTNU tried to standardize all website style need to in the same formate. After our leader order, we organized a team and hold meeting regular for review progress. The standard include "main color must like NTNU official website(brick red)", "responsive web design", "multilingualism", "business promotion", "CMS system & RBAC". Becuse we have the same experience in YoYoHakka project. we do this project fastly.
Due to our courses all most be designed for those people who mother language is chinese, the website structure are diffent between english version and chinese version. So we couldn't build one layout for  appling multilingualism config settings(i18n).
We wanted to use Laravel for implemention, but our server hold too many website which only run at old version PHP (less PHP5). So, I improved the query module in YoYoHakka project let it more like a ORM concept based query module. Simultaneously, I integrated CRSF defence, XSS defence, LOG writter in this module. If my co-workers develp a CRUD application, it will do there checked and create log.
