After examing, all answers will be imported to this system. There are two system roles, one is meeting host and another is scoring specialist. Their mission is scoring all speaking answers and writing answers. Each answer has to be reviewed twice. If there is a huge gap between first reviewing and secorned reviewing, we need to do third reviewing by another specialist. This system has a lot of useful function like making some mark on answer paper, counting spended seconds of reviewing, analyzing all report in the smallest dimension(In ths case, the smallest dimension is question).
