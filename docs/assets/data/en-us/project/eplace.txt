NTNU hotel and classroom management is a part of duties for NTNU Extenstion, School of Continuing Education. We have ordering and management system for hotel already, but place managament system not yet. This system could help student affairs office create a row about classroom reservation. I used fullcalender.js make these data visually. User could browse data in dimension of month, week even day. At the end of 2016, we imported old data to this system. With TV wall and electric board, our students could find their classroom fastly.
