YoYoHakka is organized by "Hakka Affairs Council" and is implemented by "National Taiwan Normal University". The purpose of this activity is Hakka language promotion.
Before 2014, we only had registion system and management system. Since I started maintain these systems, I develped a system for arranging examinees. This system will get the shortest distance between examinee's home and examination area by "Google Distance Matrix" service. Becuse of some register's personal reason, we need to adjust default result. So I build a back-end for tuning those response from Google.
After project closed temporary, I tried to optimize these system. I wanted to using ASP.NET MVC or other PHP framewrok for system rebuilding, but the cost of learning a framework is too high at that time. So, it's a pity that we shelved this idea. However, I develped a query module by PDO. Besides, I used SCSS for design css stylesheet, all website RWD optimization.
