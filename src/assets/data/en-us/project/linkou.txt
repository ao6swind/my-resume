Due to NTNU Division of Proparatory Programs for Overseas Chinese Students(NUPS) want to change the proportion of counting score, they need to modifiy their system. However the vendor of education system has no ability to maintain, NUPS appointed SCE to devolpe a new education system. At begining, I designed the prototype of layout, authentication and some CRUD module. Because SCE want to devolpe more exam system module, and Iâ€™m responsible exam system. So, I pass this project to another co-worker. In 2018 Jan, the coworker quit. So I continue finish this project(2018/02/26 production release). Althought this project let me know a lot of skill about Laravel like Eloquent ORM, validation etc., what impressed me most is about management. Due to we didn't code review, I got a low quality code. It affects schedules of others project. So, we will practive code review, version controlling and build milestone for avoid more mistake.
