This project started when I fulfill alternative military service of education. During that time, my duties is directing traffic, campus patrol and general affairs processing. One day, a upperclassmen in NTNU told me that Dr. Lin had a project which need building a system. She asked me that did I have free time for developing this system.
After system requirements interview, I knew the goal was designing eight session about digital living technology textbook and using this textbook to make pre-test and post-test for finding any difference between test group(using the digital textbook) and control group.
I tried to make this textbook has more interesting, so I refered some games like "Rainy Port Keelung". First, I created a lot of character images by generater. According to the different script, these characters will change they face expression. In addition, I implement multiple choice question by using HTML5 drag/grop api in order to make exercise be fun.
I translated these scripts to JSON formate, this process let me learned that importance of back-end. Thanks for Dr. Lin & other friends gave me this opportunity
