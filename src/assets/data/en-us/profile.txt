　　My major is education. Due to some occasions, I started learning something about information technology include system management ans software engineering. During my graduate studies, I started learning building website. When I served for country(alternative military service in education), a upperclassman in NTNU asked me that could I help to develop a system. So, I spend my free time to do this project. After I completed alternative military service, the doctor who is my advisor invited me to join his team at NTNU extension school of continuing education.

In 2017, I am appointed team leader, I am interested in .NET MVC CORE, Angularjs, Xamarin and other APP project.
